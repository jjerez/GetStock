# GetStock
Python implementation of a UDP client-server model to retrieve stock quotes from a server

A user registers on the client-side, can unregister, and can request stock quotes from a server-side table using commands sent to the server. The server replies with status messages based on the requests, defined in the protocol standard for GetStock version 1.5, created by students in the Fall 2015 CNT 4400: Computer Networks course.
